## CI for Python Applications

**Common CI steps:**

- **Linting:** Linting is the process of analyzing code for potential errors, stylistic problems, and other best practices. Common Python linters include:
  - Pylint
  - Flake8
  - Black
- **Testing:** Testing is the process of verifying that code works as expected. Common Python testing frameworks include:
  - Unittest
  - PyTest
  - Nose
- **Building:** Building is the process of packaging code into a deployable format. Common Python build tools include:
  - Pipenv
  - Poetry
  - Flit

**CI tools:**

- **Jenkins:** Jenkins is a popular open-source CI/CD server. It is highly customizable and extensible, but it can be complex to set up and manage.
- **GitHub Actions:** GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform built into GitHub. It is easy to use and maintain, but it may not be as feature-rich as Jenkins.
- **Other CI tools:** There are many other CI tools available, including:
  - CircleCI
  - Travis CI
  - CodeShip
  - Semaphore CI

**Self-hosted vs. cloud-based CI:**

- **Self-hosted CI:** Self-hosted CI gives you complete control over your CI environment, but it requires you to manage and maintain your own hardware and software.
- **Cloud-based CI:** Cloud-based CI is easier to set up and manage than self-hosted CI, but you may have less control over your CI environment.

**Which CI setup is best for you?**

The best CI setup for you depends on your specific needs and requirements. Consider the following factors when making your decision:

- **Team size:** If you have a small team, you may want to consider a cloud-based CI solution. Self-hosted CI can be more complex and time-consuming to manage for small teams.
- **Budget:** Self-hosted CI can be more expensive than cloud-based CI, especially if you need to purchase and maintain your own hardware.
- **Control:** If you need complete control over your CI environment, then self-hosted CI is the best option. However, if you are willing to give up some control for ease of use and management, then cloud-based CI is a good option.

**Recommendation for a 6-person team developing a Python application:**

For a 6-person team developing a Python application, I would recommend using a cloud-based CI solution, such as GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions is easy to set up and maintain, and it is well-suited for small teams.

You can customize this pipeline to meet your specific needs. For example, you may want to add additional steps for linting, code coverage, or security scanning. You can also add additional jobs to deploy the application to different environments, such as staging and production.
